# Food Inflation Analysis Project

This project analyzes food price inflation across major economic periods, comparing trends in healthy vs. unhealthy food categories. It leverages statistical analysis and visualization to provide insights into food price dynamics over time.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── ai-documentation.txt # Documentation related to AI or automated analysis
├── contribution_statement.md # Contribution statement
├── environment.yml # Conda environment specification
├── Makefile # Build automation
├── notebooks/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and exploration
├── project-description.md # Project overview and objectives
├── utils/ # Utility scripts for data processing or visualization
├── data/ # Raw and processed data
├── figures/ # Generated figures and plots
├── outputs/ # Analysis outputs (tables, reports)
├── README.md # This file
├── _build/ # Built documentation and site output
└── myst.yml # MyST configuration for documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed.

### Environment Setup

Create and activate the environment:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate food_inflation
```

### Running Notebooks

All analysis notebooks are in the notebooks/ directory. You can open and run them using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Building the Documentation

This project uses MyST and a Makefile to generate a site in _build/.
